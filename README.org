* drowning-balcony

This project aims to realize a watering system for a balcony.
** Questions:
*** Do we need multiple humidity sensors?
Different plants have different needs. It's okay to use one sensor for one large pot if there's only one type of plant.
*** Do we need multiple water pipes?
There are a couple ideas to do this:
1. If the plants are in one row in multiple balcony troughs :seedling::seedling::seedling::seedling:, we will use a servo motor to move one single pipe along them. Of course the pipe is connected to water supply and a pump. The motor and the pump are both controlled by a microcontroller.
  
Another idea is to use one pipe with multiple valves that are opened electronically.
  
2. If we want to water multiple pots, we can either use multiple pipes or control one pipe with a motor and spray the plants, knowing the angle and pressure needed. This has been done [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Automatic-Watering-System-For-Plants/?ALLSTEPS).
